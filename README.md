## Prerequisites
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Node.js and NPM. We prefer using [NVM (Linux/Mac)](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) or [NVM-Windows (Windows)](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#installation--upgrades). Once you have installed the NVM version for your machine, use that to install the latest stable versions of Node and NPM via `nvm install node` (Mac/Linux) or `nvm install latest` (Windows).

## Getting started
- Open your terminal/command prompt, and navigate to your usual projects directory
- Run the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/onehungrymind/angular-electron-workshop.git
cd angular-electron-workshop
npm install -g @angular/cli
npm install
npm run build-electron
npm run start-electron
```
The app will now be running in a new window. Snap away, my friends!
